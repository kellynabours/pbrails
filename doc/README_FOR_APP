Run "rake doc:app" to generate API documentation for your models, controllers, helpers, and libraries.


KELLY: Started recreating Product Bible in Rails.

Generated controller by "rails generate controller home index"
   This seem to create the controller "home", with a function "index", and a view for that.
Generated model "user" "rails generate model user" 
   This seems to create the model, and a migration file.  Modified the migration file to have a "name" field also.
   rake db:migrate to run them, which then actually creates the table.
Generated controller for User
   added function to do ldap_authentication
   added functions for Login and Logout.  Login display the template if no parameters, or logins you in if there are parameters.
Modified application_controller.
   added before_filter to check that user is logged in, except when calling "login".

OK, user authentication is implemented, and no other controllers can be called if you are not logged in.
